In my game I can track the challenges a player has solved by perhaps creating:
public static void Checklist() {
and using while loops that make an if statement in Checklist print DONE while
the challenges method(s) are completed.
I can track HP by passing a new value to a variable each time HP is affected.
Items, ditto.
