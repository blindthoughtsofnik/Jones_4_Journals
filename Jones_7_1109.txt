I'm not ready to begin coding my game.
Im not ready because I have no idea what my storyline is going to be nor do I
have any relative idea of a theme my game will follow.
My biggest challenge will be coding my game correctly.
This will be my biggest challange because my coding always comes use with
errors due to my imcapability of typing things ({, ;)
