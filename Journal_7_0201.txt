The challenge that my player has to solve, is to escape their kidnappers lair. 
Youre tasked to find your way out of the house (lair) and you must hide from 
and enemies, as well as protect yourself from detection.
I can only track this by the enemies hitboxes to see if the character has
been detected, which would result in capture, as well as if the character has left
the house, resulting in a win.
