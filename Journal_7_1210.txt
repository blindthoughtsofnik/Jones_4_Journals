The type of 2-D world I would like to have, would most likely be modeled after
a typical modern house, This would be because I'd make a sort of escape game
where you've been captured by a serial killer and he's locked you in a maze
where you have to overcome obstactles in order to escape (Sort of like the 
survival idea Jigsaw has in "Saw".).
