The reason we should revise our games is to be able to complete a more advanced level of coding. With revising, we can further understand the different types of codes to create a more lucrative, and immersive game.
Simple mistakes in our games, such as unblocked tiles, can be fixed for a better layout.
On top of this we can add sounds, and weapons to fight in our games
